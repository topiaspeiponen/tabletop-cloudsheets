# Tabletop Cloudsheets

Tabletop Cloudsheets is a RPG character management platform built for use with dynamic importable and exportable sheets. All of the available RPG character (D&D 5e, Pathfinder 2e, etc) management platforms available today have their own custom character management UI, with some having the possibility of exporting your character as a PDF. The focus of Tabletop Cloudsheets is to offer a sheet customization UI that emulates the actual fillable PDFs, with the possiblity to bring your own PDF or export your character as a PDF.
