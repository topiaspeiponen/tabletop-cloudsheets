# Tabletop Cloudsheets

Tabletop Cloudsheets is a RPG character management platform built for use with dynamic fillable PDFs. All of the available RPG character (D&D 5e, Pathfinder 2e, etc) management platforms available today have their own custom character management UI, with some having the possibility of exporting your character as a PDF. None offer the possibility of using a straight up PDF file as your character management UI in the cloud, with quick import and export functions.

You can check out the current production version at: https://tabletop-cloudsheets.herokuapp.com/

The project is written in Typescript and uses the following libraries/frameworks:
- React
- Material UI
- Redux
- Express
- Jest
- Webpack
